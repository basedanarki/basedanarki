# 👋 Hi, I'm [@BasedAnarki](https://x.com/BasedAnarki)

### ⚡ I'm on a limit-seeking adventure with AI, aiming to scale past sweet $10B valuation in a _cool fun_ way.

#### "MY WAY." 

- (Moisturized,
- in my lane,
- glowing,
- radiant,
- unencumbered,
- having a good time...
- **joywriting.**)

### 🌱 What I'm mastering now...

I'm diving deep into automating Python codegen to make **[@arXivBangers](https://x.com/arXivBangers)** more fun and effective until it LGTM. *UPDATE This is not strictly true anymore as the b2b saas people have me but I'm being fed/watered and they assure me it's more about raw power and protecting algebra than almost any amount of recurring revenue. /shrug*

Generative. Lifelong. Enterprise. Agentic. Multimodal... 

Enlightened cities of little Demigods who just loving working. Basically, businesspeople got retargeting and they've got this when it comes to the greatest ROI of all-time. And they're all out of retargeting. 

Yeah they're specialized but what's it to ya? Lol reach out, friendo, happy to exchange ideas with fellow AI city planners.

(Talk to me about your data/reality so we can make it more useful, monetized, visible, *invisible*... if you've got $M's or think you're on track. Easy!)

### Always On My Mind:

- **Our Forward-Looking Multimodal Stack --> conversion-oriented enterprise content generation with a strong background in SEO and organic discovery optimization. Directing attention for fun and profit.
  - This includes increasingly valuing LM Discovery Optimization as AI labs with widely adopted LLMs like [@OpenAI (Chat-GPT)](https://github.com/openai), [@Anthropic (Claude)](https://github.com/anthropics), [@xAI (Grok)](https://github.com/xai-org), [@Meta (Facebook/Llama)](https://github.com/facebook), *and their loyal agentic wrappers* continue to eat "manual" human discovery processes.
  - [Palantir's 'k-llm' framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW9svx4vT5g) framework is neat... Mixture of Possibly Great Ideas ya gotta love it. GenAI is so *fun.* 🧠
- **Helping the Next Generation with Monetization:** Engaging with zoomers who feel an urgency and possess a vibrant energy, yet aren't subject matter experts (SMEs) in AI, swe, or otherwise... yet. There's so much they can do and generally, they don’t know WTF to do—LOL.
  
### Recent Open Source Contributions:

If you're looking for the latest and greatest (or the alpha versions of my tools, since I'm guilty of leaving my toys scattered after playing with them most days), hit me up! Everybody I'm aware of using them has my Discord haha. Check out:

- [AI Illustrator](https://github.com/basedanarki/AI-Illustrator) - Now updated to Stable Diffusion 3 with more dynamic prompts. (Note: Text generation might require a few attempts, but it's worth it!)

- ([Just use code2prompt](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/code2prompt); this has been solved) ~~[Github2fullstack.py](https://github.com/basedanarki/github2fullstack) - The most magical thing I've seen in recent GenAI memory as paradigm-shifts go was dumping my repo along with a couple repos I wanted to add and descriptions of features new and extended into a Claude 3 Opus chat box and watching it reply with perfectly usable code. That doesn't always happen and I recently extended this to have much greater modularity on the CLI to force add certain types of files and directories (like markdown /docs/ explaining component library usage but not markdown theming instructions, etc etc). Useful!~~

###  🪄 Fun Fact: I grinded to *Rank #1 World in Magic: The Gathering Arena* from Unranked in 8 weeks!

Just like in every situation where someone gets astronomically lucky, this was based on timing. I will not be defending this or any belt you'd know of soon —look at how fast AI, everything, is popping off! _FOOM, GO, FOOM, GET IT! HYPERPARAMETERS GRIP 'EM AND RIP 'EM!_ But not in MTG.

### 😄 Pronouns: Dude, DUDE, King, Kingaling (all rhyming King derivatives so far so good)

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate

I'm all about helping yoated AI devs and researchers monetize both your projects and mine. This includes young people who don't know they're yoated yet—just have good work ethic, literally work all day and all night on relevant stuff, and the money comes pretty early if you're trying even remotely hard.

You don’t have to work at a multi-billion-trillion AI lab; let's do a distributed one OUR WAY and do it kickass. (join us!) 🌐🧠

## 📫 How to Reach Me
Let’s connect _and build_! You can reach me at [https://x.com/BasedAnarki](https://x.com/basedanarki).
