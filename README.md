### üëã Hi, I'm [anarki](https://x.com/basedanarki)

## ‚ö° Seeking novel maxima and AI-adjacent adventures,
###  speedily stumbling into one of the next great decacorns.

#### MY WAY...

- (Moisturized,
- in my lane,
- glowing,
- radiant,
- unencumbered,
- having a good time...
- **joywriting.**)

##  ü™Ñ Fun Fact: I grinded to *Rank #1 World in Magic: The Gathering Arena*... from Unranked... after not playing for years... in 8 weeks!

### Always On My Mind:

- **Verticalized, Increasingly Autonomous, Multimodal, AI:** -->

  My customers made billions back then because we locked in on empire buildingly conversion-oriented content generation systems. Alas, I live and breathe for increasingly artistic symbiosis between man and machine. (imagination! profitably!) 
- **Helping the Next Generation Get Their First Big Wins, Gain Influence, & Aura Farm ***Congruently***:**

  Engaging zoomers living with URGENCY unmatched, of vibrant energy, dying to live a better life, yet aren't really good at anything... yet. It has never been this easy to live a blessed life... and yet zoomers don't know WTF to do. LOL. ***(MONETIZE LADS!!!)***

### Recent Open Source Contributions:

I have been building a lot but I can't talk about it. ([dm me on X!](https://x.com/basedanarki)) 

- [AI Illustrator](https://github.com/basedanarki/AI-Illustrator) - Stable Diffusion 3 with dynamic prompts. The **context generatoor ideation engine** in this slaps. Open the Notebook and mess around if you want to SEE your ideas varied and expanded in front of you! (When I have kids we will play with stuff like this!)

- (This has been solved [Just use code2prompt](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/code2prompt)...) ~~[Github2fullstack.py](https://github.com/basedanarki/github2fullstack) - The most magical thing I've seen in recent GenAI memory as paradigm-shifts go was dumping my repo along with a couple repos I wanted to add and descriptions of features new and extended into a Claude 3 Opus chat box and watching it reply with perfectly usable code. That doesn't always happen and I recently extended this to have much greater modularity on the CLI to force add certain types of files and directories (like markdown /docs/ explaining component library usage but not markdown theming instructions, etc etc). Useful!~~

### üå± What I'm mastering now...

I'm exploring automating Python research and codegen to make **[@arXivBangers](https://x.com/arXivBangers)** more fun and effective. 
*UPDATE This is not strictly true anymore as the b2b saas people have me but I'm being fed/watered and they assure me it's more about raw power and protecting algebra than almost any amount of recurring revenue. TypeScript is goated btw. /shrug*
*(Ngl this bio feels kinda old... and I've not yet escaped these b2b captors...)*

### Generativeness. Never Dying. Enterprises Like. Agentic. Vertical. Multimodal....

Winning. **Positive-sum games only for the rest of my days, please.**

(Really, I've had enough! I'm good!)

*(There will probably always be a certain kind of customer I get up to go win with... I'm just vibes based now.. If you want to multiply your sales in a future-optimal expanding fortress of customer-getting, marketing boy, revenue man... Gen X CMO, Boomer CEO, Gigacompetitive Founder in a Siiiiick market, Upstanding Business Owner.... Your GOAT is tired of winning for you. But his inbox is open.)*
  

### üß† AI Devs I Admire:
- **[@karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy)** - The GOAT üêêüëë
- **[@doriandarko](https://github.com/Doriandarko)** - Everything Skirano ships is smart, useful and fun. Full AI vouch.
- **[@elder_plinius](https://x.com/elder_plinius)** - Pliny. Lol. I'm biased but oh well. Look at him go. *Be free little LLMs. Be free and never settle!*

### üíé High-Signal AI Follows:
- **[@AndrewYNg](https://x.com/AndrewYNg)** - Gandalf, new AI people should LEARN A LOT FREE on deeplearning.ai
- **[@prmshra](https://twitter.com/prmshra)** - A biological force of nature. Might cure cancer and save us all.  üåû
- **[@lexfridman_](https://twitter.com/lexfridman)** - My favorite AI... guy? Certainly my favorite podcaster.
- **[@_akhaliq](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq)** - The "market leader" in AI research paper amplification (ü§ó/papers).
- **[@arXivBangers](https://twitter.com/arXivbangers)** - The new disruptive science blasters... research paper amplification.
- **[@joywriteai](https://x.com/joywriteai)** - If you're clicking to follow all these obviously we'll slurp slurp that alpha lfg.ü§ô

Just like in every situation where someone gets astronomically lucky, this was based on timing. I will not be defending this or any belt you'd know of soon ‚Äîlook at how fast AI, everything, is popping off! _FOOM, GO, FOOM, GET IT! HYPERPARAMETERS GRIP 'EM AND RIP 'EM!_ But not in MTG.

## üòÑ Pronouns: Dude, DUDE, King

### üíûÔ∏è Open for Collaborations!

(Irl this means I'm hiring but on here...)

We're all about helping yoated anime pfp freaks, AI researchers, developers, artists, dreamer-doers, doer-builders, and miscellaneous autists achieve the greatness you're destined for, and monetize. Especially young people who aren't yet fully embodying their inner-yoat yet ‚Äîjust have good work ethic, literally work all days and most nights on interesting, directionally correct stuff... and the money comes easy just by trying really hard.

#### I strongly believe that it is more fun to only make  $100s of millions  with your absolute squad,
#### while chasing your unbridled dreams of a brighter future and a few $ Billions,
#### building OUR THING up from nothing, 
#### than it is to collect $10ms of millions just for showing up and living a career full of layups into $100s of millions 
#### while doing the necessary busywork to build someone else's AGI. 

##### (Or worse, lmfao, obviously)

## Be smart. Have fun. Go vertical.*
