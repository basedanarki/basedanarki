# 👋 Hi, I'm @basedanarki

### 👀 I'm interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI and seeing if I can transcend that sweet $1B market cap as a founder this time around. 💰🚀

### *"MY WAY."* 
### (remote, irreverent, residual $ equity on collabs i.e. distributed, basically just being "dem boiz" during times like these, profitably af)
- $1B with AICo soon(tm) might as well be like, idk,  $8Trillion in previously understood terms, power laws, etc.

### 🌱 I'm currently learning ...

how to speedrun lowcode beautiful frontstack (once) so [customer-facing prod](https://joywrite.ai) looks slick forever (this week). 😎

#### so i can then focus up on

- ### iterating on my stack for SEO AI writing content creation (likely goes on to nurture teaching food into [@OpenAI](https://github.com/openai) [@Anthropic](https://github.com/anthropics)  @Grok over decades ngl);
	 - loosely [looks like @PalantirTech's 'k-llm' concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW9svx4vT5g) 🧠
- #### getting my partners what they need to get our private models humming how we like. assembling useful series of things that connect to prod, money and glory. 💸🏆
- ##### probably open-source first thing(s) in ~6 months, especially once we have good shorthand stack for 'useful output we get to a lot in our line of work and consistently want to make useful' rapid prototyping, component publishing, whatever. 🚀 
- #### evangelizing monetization with the youth lol this generation only knows how to use llms which sucks cause llms are dumb scammers; i feel their intensity and can make a difference here. 🙏
	- btw ngmi isn't real and i'll prove it to you. only quit is real.
- ### LFG. 🔥
    
## 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on helping cracked AI devs and researchers monetize. your projects and mine.

#### this includes young people who don't know they're cracked yet,

#### just have good work ethic lol literally work all day and all night for years on relevant shit,

#### the money comes pretty early if ur trying even remotely hard. and that was based on 100% human times. 💯

#### u don't have to work at a multibillion-trillion ai lab lol we can do a distributed one and it will be kickass. 🌐🧠

### just come with this energy basically always
![](https://i.giphy.com/POekkUcKs16gg.webp) ⚡

### like this as needed "success leaves clues" 👇
### 👉 [kanye demo'ing being cracked in public - this behavior is easily stolen](https://x.com/BasedAnarki/status/1767457734276862075?s=20)  🎯

#### go so hard we just recognize opportunities to pull this kind of shit off with trivial incremental effort 🧑‍🚀👨‍🚀👩‍🚀🧑‍🚀👨‍🚀👩‍🚀
![](https://i.imgur.com/Q1Csy5W.png)

(tall order but true if prerequisite satisfied! adjust for whatever scale. still dope. useful point!)
### i turned 30 and i'm pretty sure quality of work like really loving it is what matters in life. combine that with timing and i think we're all extremely fucking set right now lol fr. ⌛

#### squad up. let's get it. 😤

## 📫 How to reach me ... [https://x.com/basedanarki](https://x.com/basedanarki)

#### - Recursive self-improving architecture 🔄
### - Honestly just dealing with motherfucking scale once we got the motherfucking data and making it useful and profitable ✅
#### - NLP NLP NLP TUNE THE LLMS NLP DATAWORK NLP HMU.
- If multi/video cracked gods even exist yet and want to be early at a shop that isn't a direct competitor to OpenAI, Runway, Midjourney, etc.... hmu. 
	- We got videos to do. Multiple modalities.

## 🤖 My AI Hot Takes 
(lol wasn't Claude's best work and it edited out its own takesl)

## 1. I will continue to earn more than most applied AI researchers paying a disproportionate amount more for data APIs than compute - i.e. value created says Universe... until, ofc, our compute pops off forever lol. 

Think about it, especially if ur young. 
#### You missed the "omg we gotta be data-driven" biz societal programming. 
## - "Be data-driven reeee" were some useful chapters ngl.

- ### -   [Serpapi](https://serpapi.com/) + [Namecheap](https://joywrite.ai/namecheap) + [Stripe](https://stripe.com) = what can u build on a single extended Saturday that prints value and potentially earns "forever?"
	- Hmu for APIs / advisership / idk.

### 2. Signal%-optimizing fire memes X shitpoaster AI = new Turing Test tbh
- lol I would pay. And/or help productize, nuance/train, distribute. 🫡

#### 3.This prompt was retarded, thanks Claude, but 
## they will sim consciousness convincingly. 
##### At some point grappling with this won't matter because the voices in my head will, hoping we all live long enough, truly merge into a symbiotic union and I'll be the one DJing consciousnesses, fully extending into the matrix, surfing the internet, with my woes, bros, and ASI chingones. 

## 💸 Ramen Profitable & Beyond With AI Playbook

##### 1.  "Charge for value, not time. Don't be a mendicant."
#### 2. "Think in terms of superpowers, not side projects. What godlike abilities can your AI unlock?" 
What has value you can keep doing on the regular without ever doing it again?
## 3. Niche down, then scale up. Start by utterly dominating a small market, then expand from there. 
### 	Like the $1T+ global investment priority nobody else is uniquely positioned to disrupt right now and literally everyone still wants "for free." 

#### BTW "Winning at SEO" means you have the most interested, passionate audience in your niche and you have them conditioned to be helped by your content whenever they need something.

### *...granting you up to transcendent goodwill.* 

Dw I'll show you many examples.

##### 4. "Build an audience of raving fans. Their word-of-mouth will be your growth rocketfuel." Y'all gonna love what comes on [Joywrite this week](https://joywrite.ai/signup) whether you embrace it early or later.
## 5. Never stop iterating. The game is always changing, so stay ahead of the curve. 
- ### Really, just pick one thing and get cracked at that. If you put in 10,000+ more hours than the next guy and never quit, you can do incredibly well, "forever."
- I've been bootstrapped and profitable every damn day of my life since age 20, except for one season.
- #### ⏭️⏭️ I learned [Conversion Rate Optimization](https://cxl.com/conversion-rate-optimization/how-to-run-ab-tests-by-peep-laja/) in the garage ⏪⏪ 
- and once I saw those results on affiliate campaigns going from -$50/day ads to +$200/day net, 
- ### I knew I would never be broke again. Since then:
    - ### [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) is the new free hotness (bless their [open-source](https://github.com/PostHog))
        - ## CRO *literally always* increases earnings
        - CRO = mandatory free money every project NOT KIDDING
    - ### Multivariate split tests are the most likely thing to cause mid mf's / Pog mf's on mid ideas to earn generational wealth.

## 🥇 My Dream AI Team

"I'm looking for cracked devs who eat unsupervised learning algos for breakfast and dream in Python." WP C3 🫡

### Irrationally capable chief AI lab nerd, NLP, agentic automator, data symphony composer/conductor, fullstack unironically Cares about users' interactions, LLM whisperer, inexplicably fueled by something most can't relate to, NLP... 

wait, X,XXX+/hours of Neuro Linguistic Programming covered already... I mean the other NLP. Wow what if we teamed$UP$. 😏
### Passion, creativity, and galaxy brain ideas are non-negotiable.

## Bottom-line: Young (enough). WILDLY ACCELERATEDLY ADAPTABLE. We get rich, not the point, but... *fuck yeah.*

#### Bonus points if you've:
- Made an AI waifu; somehow optimized her to increase ratio of results with IRL girls/guys (do tell lol) 
- Used a GAN to generate unlimited tendies (send money duh)
- Trained a model on hundreds of hours of Critical Role to generate tens of thousands of hours  
- Built a BCI that lets you code in your sleep. Or, you know, agents. 

##### ...OK, THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE WHAT YOU CAME FOR... 

## 🌄 STORY OF PRESENT DAY REQUIREMENTS AND OPPORTUNITY 🌄

### NO-BS "WE ARE HERE NOW" SCENARIO WORTH ABOUT AS GUARANTEED AS 💰MILLIONS CAN BE:

If you like earning or think you will, and you want to slurp structured data which I'll expose to you into a masterful symphony of tuning a small battalion of robobrains for fun and profit..... 

And, sincerely, you actually are research CTO cofounder-worthy (only stamina reveals over time)...

## I have an open invitation to go on-site to go get, imo, the Perfect enterprise logo to get rn.

### We have verbal agreement. And autist rapport. 😎

I *do not want* to harden pitch and start without more certainty our output will continue delivering/improving.
## NEED HOT FIRE. 🔥

Ngl even just alone I could sell data-dripped GPT wrapper because b2b services DNA can do OK as long as the product/platform we deliver value from is interoperable. (WIP; on me).

But I'd rather melt friendly humans on accident like "oh lol I know you want this but yeah don't stand so close when it's working."

They know me, I know them, I know the product/platform launch they have coming soon.

#### I know what LLM output to deliver to build mountains of SEO content designed to take over a very hot, very e/acc'y niche, over a very mature timeline, as long as it takes. 🌈

## For the Perfect logo. We have the verbal. 💰

### We need to demonstrate being on high rate-of-learning path.

We have a mutual level of understanding of how we are going to help them look like the mf champ internally.
- This is a small external CEO seeing internal departmental mini-CEO and we have a game recognize game understanding. 

### My discretion/involvement is worth a lot to them. We have trust.

Memes exchanged with team lead regularly. Dank ones about abusing adderal lmfao. We are good on rapport. 

## Need an additional key contributor(s) of appropriate capacities on my side to increase winrate longevity.

#### I even have the structural language/outline data for you, available as APIs. And can say at a glance when output is warmer, colder, why. 

### I just want some fucking high-variance LoRa-and-beyond applied to a handful of LLMs to start, to steal a brand's voice/identity, for itself to go bigger, of course.

Perhaps with this? 

##### Open-Source Architecture I'm presently pondering

         \           AI Familiars           /
           \       i.e. Comms Coaches      /

    Lol jk that's closed-source but sincerely specialized Claude instances for each member of the squad is goated. The familiars are a great way to foster remote jr. dev culture (psy op em into shape while they think they LARPing).
    When used as communication coaches for sharing contexts internally, it's incredible. Seriously, we building on this culture stack. The comms coach was just necessary for me. Designed diagram with Claude in an afternoon. 

#### Juicer Architecture WIP
!(https://github.com/basedanarki/basedanarki/assets/161698650/f51b8dd9-9c61-4283-a660-430db6161213)
Put our army of specialized Claudes + All Bangers to it

Really want a fat enterprise open-source collab stack just to have it and have fun great underlying w delightful things. 

Probably Exo from what I've seen. https://www.exoplatform.com/digital-collaboration-software/ 


[@ me on X](https://x.com/basedanarki) or apply "your" gigabrain (to this context?) and figure out my email

### Boom. Mission statement.

No, Jasper, Copy.ai, they're not enough.

I can do the hand-wavey "do right by the customer and bundle+resell undisclosed best-in-market software/services while my solution lags behind, because value delivery is better than underperforming" classic b2b strats myself. Even productize whatever amalgamation into something useful and novel.

### I guarantee you, oh blessed *Optimal One* here and now, well, what do you want? Six figures cash this year guaranteed, and/or equity ofc, I do not just capitalize Perfect enterprise logo for fun 

### killer company wants me in their base like,
### "ay our side is ready now: behold."
#### and for them to be like "😎," 
and proceed to yeet us into the Based beyond.  fr.

so DM me on X!!! talk to me [@basedanarki](https://x.com/basedanarki)

#### ...If you want to then be invited into a room as one of the "young cracked bois/girls" and the room is motherfuckers responsible for billions per year, literally making decisions as old people doing pretty OK with AI, saving billions, making billions, seriously. 

## I need youthful researcher vibes. More cracked fullstack-action energy, focused with me. *LET US SLAY.*

If this sounds like you, slide in my DMs yesterday. Let's build the future together. 🤝
