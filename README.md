# 👋 Hi, I'm [@BasedAnarki](https://x.com/BasedAnarki)

### ⚡ I'm on a limit-seeking adventure with AI, aiming to scale past sweet $1B valuation in a _cool_ way.

#### "MY WAY."

- (Moisturized,
- in my lane,
- glowing,
- radiant,
- unencumbered,
- having a good time...
- joywriting.)

### 🌱 What I'm mastering now...

I'm diving deep into automating fullstack/ML Python development to make **[@arXivBangers](https://x.com/arXivBangers)** more fun and effective until it LGTM and I yolo push to prod. Modern frontend up next (Vite/React/TypeScript/IDKYetExtendies)!

Then, Enterprise. Generative. Multimodal. Agentic... basically the most cracked, self-improving, working 24/7 teams scaled up underneath a social professional workflow app that just makes sense. Cheapest ROI of all-time --and we do mean _all-time_-- if you've got B's. Share your data so we can make it useful if you've got or are getting M's. Easy! _Soon™!_

### Current Focus:

- **Our Forward-Looking Multimodal Stack:** Iterating on --> build/rent/optimize --> our stack for conversion-oriented enterprise content generation with a strong background in SEO and discovery optimization. This includes increasingly valuing LLM-Based discovery optimization as major players like @OpenAI, @Anthropic, @Grok, and @Meta continue to evolve. [Like Palantir's 'k-llm' concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oW9svx4vT5g) applied additionally along width of creative solutions considered, as a system, and no fear around depth/complexity when we know we're going deep into building systems that create the right things. GenAI is so *fun!* 🧠
- **Helping the Next Generation with Monetization:** Engaging with zoomers who feel an urgency and possess a vibrant energy, yet aren't subject matter experts (SMEs) in AI... yet. There's so much they can do and generally, they don’t know WTF to do—LOL.
  
### Recent Open Source Contributions:

If you're looking for the latest and greatest (or the alpha versions of my tools, since I'm guilty of leaving my toys scattered after playing with them most days), hit me up! Everybody I'm aware of using them has my Discord haha. Check out:

- [AI Illustrator](https://github.com/basedanarki/AI-Illustrator) - Now updated to Stable Diffusion 3 with more dynamic prompts. (Note: Text generation might require a few attempts, but it's worth it!)

- [Github2fullstack.py](https://github.com/basedanarki/github2fullstack) - The most magical thing I've seen in recent GenAI memory as paradigm-shifts go was dumping my repo along with a couple repos I wanted to add and descriptions of features new and extended into a Claude 3 Opus chat box and watching it reply with perfectly usable code. That doesn't always happen and I recently extended this to have much greater modularity on the CLI to force add certain types of files and directories (like markdown /docs/ explaining component library usage but not markdown theming instructions, etc etc). Useful!

### 🧠 AI Devs I Admire:

- **[@arXivBangers](https://twitter.com/arXivbangers)** - The new perhaps disruptive blasters of science... research paper amplification

###  🪄 Fun Fact: *Rank #1 (World) in Magic: The Gathering Arena*

And no, I don't have time to do it again right now—look at how fast AI, everything, is popping off!! 

### 😄 Pronouns: Dude, M'lord

### 💞️ Looking to Collaborate

I'm all about helping cracked AI devs and researchers monetize both your projects and mine. This includes young people who don't know they're cracked yet—just have good work ethic, literally work all day and all night on relevant stuff, and the money comes pretty early if you're trying even remotely hard.

You don’t have to work at a multi-billion-trillion AI lab; let's do a distributed one OUR WAY and do it kickass. (join me!) 🌐🧠

## 📫 How to Reach Me
Let’s connect and build something revolutionary! You can reach me at [https://x.com/BasedAnarki](https://x.com/basedanarki).
